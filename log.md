## Hi! 👋🏻

I'm a former pianist & piano teacher who in 2017 started to code. So far, I've done the "Build websites from scratch" course at Codecademy plus experimented with making images & animations with code, like the self portrait above (pure CSS - no SVGs) 👩🏻‍💻
<br/> ➡️ Some of the things I've made: https://codepen.io/Antzee
<br/> ➡️ You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Antzee_)

⭐️ My main goals for 100 Days Of Code: improve my HTML/CSS skills + learn more about JavaScript.⭐️

## Log 🗓

### Day 1 - Monday 01.01.2018
Simple start: commit to the 100 Days Of Code challenge and set it up on GitHub. Also (although it's not really coding) learn how to use markup language to format and add images in my log.
<br/><br/>
### Day 2 - Tuesday 02.01.2018
Did the three first lessons of Scrimba's "Learn CSS Grid for free" online course. It seems really good since it's an interactive video so I could play with edits both on the interface and in my own editor. Link: https://scrimba.com/g/gR8PTE

[This talk](http://bit.ly/1byDzwo) by Kathy Sierra made me realise that I need to change how I study JavaScript (which I until now have found really difficult). So I’ve decided to try another way of structuring my learning process. Instead of just following one learning source, I'll:
- *combine different learning sources (videos and text)*
- *write my own versions of examples*
- *not move on until I feel comfortable with each topic.*

Today, I went back to the beginning and revised variables & arrays. It's not the hardest part of JavaScript, but a good way of setting up and practicing a different workflow.

Today’s learning sources:
- [“Practical Javascript” by Gordon Zhu on Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript)
- [“The complete JavaScript course” by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/)
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) for additional examples.
