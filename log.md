## Hi! 👋🏻

I'm a former pianist & piano teacher who in 2017 started to code. So far, I've done the "Build websites from scratch" course at Codecademy plus experimented with making images & animations with code, like the self portrait above (pure CSS - no SVGs) 👩🏻‍💻
<br/>My main goals for 100 Days Of Code: improve my HTML/CSS skills + learn more about JavaScript.
<br/> ➡️ Some of the things I've made: https://codepen.io/Antzee

## Log 🗓

### Day 1 - 01.01.2018
Simple start: commit to the 100 Days Of Code challenge and set it up on GitHub. Also (although it's not really coding) learn how to use markup language to format and add images in my log.
